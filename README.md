# Mnemosyne MCP

A TypeScript MCP server that connects Claude to your productivity ecosystem with AI-enhanced intelligence. Unified access to FastMail, Airtable, and Linear with automatic entity extraction and cross-service correlation.

## Why This Exists

Managing information across multiple productivity tools creates fragmentation. I wanted AI assistance that understands the connections between my emails, projects, and data rather than treating each service in isolation. Mnemosyne provides unified intelligence across your productivity stack.

## Current Status: In Development

This server is actively being built. The roadmap below shows planned features and implementation phases.
